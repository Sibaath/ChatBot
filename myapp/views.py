You’ll be able to send and receive messages even in challenging locations. 🌄📡\"\nWhat if the Twilio call doesn’t go through?,\"If the call fails, Twilio will automatically try to reconnect or provide a callback when the signal improves, ensuring you don’t lose connection during emergencies. 📶📲\"\nCan I rely on the IoT device during a long-term outage?,\"Definitely! With the LoRa mesh network for communication and the crank handle for power, you can stay connected and charged for extended periods without relying on external power sources. 🔋🔄\"\nHow does the emergency number callback work?,\"Once you initiate an emergency call, Twilio tracks your signal strength.
